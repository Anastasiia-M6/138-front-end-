        <h1>INTRODUCTION <span class="chapter-title">Chapter 1</span></h1>
        <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup instructions,
            they've moved to <a href="#">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
            documentation, Native Components, React, and more!</p>

        <h2>CORE COMPONENTS <span class="chapter-title">Chapter 2</span></h2>
        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app
            platform‚Äôs native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well
            as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <em>bundles of reusable,
                nestable code</em>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
            components work in React Native.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>REACT FUNDAMENTALS <span class="chapter-title">Chapter 3</span></h2>
        <p>React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you
            started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</li>
            <li><strong>JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                JavaScript like so: <code>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</li>
            <li><strong>state.</strong> State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
                interaction. State gives your components memory!</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>HANDLING TEXT INPUT <span class="chapter-title">Chapter 4</span></h2>
        <p><code>TextInput</code> is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
            <code>onChangeText</code> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an
            <code>onSubmitEditing</code> prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>For example, let‚Äôs say that as the user types, you‚Äôre translating their words into a different language. In
            this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence ‚ÄúHello there Bob‚Äù would be
            translated as ‚Äúüçï üçï üçï‚Äù.</p>
